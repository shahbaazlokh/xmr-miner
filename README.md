# xmr-miner

xmr-miner is written in python3 and C. I have published it for Windows and Debian amd64 based systems.
Remote configuration file (eg. pastebin raw file) as input argument is implemented.
Maybe in the future, I will implement x86 and ARM (eg. Raspberry-Pi) versions (recompiling the C library).
Even in the future, maybe I will rewrite it entirely in C++ for speed improvement.

WARNING: C code is published separately in my other repo https://github.com/menekevin/cryptonight

** Last update: v9 fork support added (October 2018 fork) **
